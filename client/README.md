# About EML (Extra Mural Lectures, IITM) 
The Extra-Mural Lectures (EML) is the flagship lecture body of IITMadras that focuses on enhancing the learning of the students beyond the classroom. The EML series of IIT Madras was launched in the early 1980s by a group of enterprising students with strong encouragement and support from the institute. Over the years, this group has expanded into a formal student body that has been amplifying its outreach to the students at large. 

We inherit a strong legacy of innovative initiatives like EML Social and EML Omnibus. The team takes pride in having invited and given the IITM Student community the opportunity to interact with distinguished personalities like Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, Ms Indra Nooyi, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Mr Kailash Satyarthi, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Mr A R Rahman, Mr Viswanathan Anand, Mr Eleanor Catton, Mr SS Rajamouli and several others. The EML sessions arein the form of interactive lectures, debates, and discussions around topics concerning science, arts, culture and society, aiming at covering as diverse fields as possible.
